## 🧠 Why Kalulu?

**Kalulu** is more than just a game — it’s an educational adventure grounded in scientific research that helps children learn to read through a decoding-based method.

Each lesson follows a structured sequence based on linguistic data drawn from children's literature. Learners start with vowels and gradually move on to more complex sounds.

- 🎯 **Goal**: Make learning to read fun and effective  
- 🌟 **Science-Based**: Developed using research in education and neuroscience  
- 👶 **Target Audience**: Primarily children, but useful for anyone wanting to learn to read

## ✨ Features

- Interactive grapheme-phoneme reading lessons
- Adaptive difficulty progression
