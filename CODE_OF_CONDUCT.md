# Kalulu Code of Conduct

## Our Promise

The Kalulu community is here to learn, create, and share together.  
We promise to treat everyone with kindness and respect, whether they are a beginner, an experienced developer, a teacher, a parent, or a young learner.

We believe in curiosity, patience, and helping each other grow.

## How We Work Together

Here’s what makes our community a happy and safe place:

- Use friendly and encouraging language
- Listen to others and value their ideas
- Share knowledge and help each other solve problems
- Be patient when someone is learning something new
- Remember that mistakes are part of learning

## What We Avoid

To keep Kalulu a safe space for everyone, we don’t allow:

- Mean or hurtful words
- Making fun of someone’s questions or skills
- Bullying or harassing others
- Sharing private information without permission
- Anything that makes the community feel unsafe

## Where This Applies

This Code of Conduct applies in all Kalulu spaces:
- On GitHub (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- In chat rooms or community meetings
- Any time someone represents the Kalulu project

## If Something Feels Wrong

If you see or experience something that goes against these guidelines:
- You can tell a project maintainer or send an email to developer@excellolab.org: [Report an issue](mailto:developer@excellolab.org?subject=Kalulu%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20Report&body=Describe%20your%20concern%20here...)
- Your concern will be listened to carefully and taken seriously
- We will work together to find a fair solution

## Why This Matters

Kalulu is an educational project that exists to make learning joyful.  
By being kind, respectful, and supportive, we make sure everyone feels welcome to join in and contribute.
